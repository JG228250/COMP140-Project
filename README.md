# COMP140-Project

Playthrough:

In order to start the game, please download a zip of the project and run the COMP140 folder through Unity 2018.4.2f1.

Open the "Scenes" folder, embedded in the main "Assets" folder, and select the "MainGame" Scene. Then hit the play button at the top to enter Playmode. The game will now run until it is manually stopped, by hitting the play button again.

The game can be controlled using the Arduino based controller, however it can also be controlled using the four directional keys as the four attacks, and using the "A" and "D" keys to change direction.

Reflection:

Overall the game is nearly all that it set out to be, and I am pleased with the final product. Some things were not implemented such as the special attack, or the toggle switch for the difficulty, due to poor judgement and timing.
